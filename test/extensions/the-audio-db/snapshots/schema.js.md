            biography: `Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.␊
            In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the "spokesman of a generation", with Nirvana being considered the "flagship band" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed.␊
            Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility.`,
            biographyJP: `ニルヴァーナ (Nirvana) は、アメリカのバンド。1980年代終盤にシーンに出現し、1994年のカート自殺による活動停止までの数年に亘って、全世界の若者世代の圧倒的な支持を受けた。彼の死亡後も世界中のミュージシャンに多大な影響を与え続けている。単語「ニルヴァーナ」には、仏教用語の涅槃の境地という意味合いと「生け贄」という意味合いがある。␊
            「スメルズ・ライク・ティーン・スピリット」の爆発的ヒットによりバンドは一気に有名になり、1990年代以降のロックに絶大な影響を与え、しばしばオルタナティヴ・ロックシーンにおいて『ニルヴァーナ以降』という言い方をされる。␊

            description: `Random Access Memories is the upcoming fourth studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It will be released by Daft Life under exclusive license to Columbia Records on May 17, 2013 in Australia, May 20, 2013 in the United Kingdom and on May 21, 2013 in the United States. Work started on the record concurrently with the Tron: Legacy score, without a clear plan as to what its structure would be. Shortly after Daft Punk signed with Columbia, a gradual promotional rollout began for the album including billboards, television advertising and a web series.␊
            Random Access Memories pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has generally been positive.`,

Fue lanzado oficialmente el 17 de mayo en Australia, lanzado después en el Reino Unido el 20 de mayo y para Estados Unidos el 21 de mayo de 2013, bajo licencia de Daft Life. El inicio de grabación de este disco inició cuando el dúo preparaba el soundtrack de la película Tron: Legacy, sin un plan claro en cuanto a lo que sería su estructura. Después de haber anunciado su nuevo contrato con Columbia Records, Daft Punk empezó a promocionar el nuevo álbum con cartéles, anuncios televisivos y series para internet.␊
            ␊
            Random Access Memories hace un tributo a la música estadounidense de la época de los 1970s y la primera parte de los 1980s, particularmente al sonido de Los Ángeles durante esa época. Daft Punk grabó el álbum en gran parte con orquesta en vivo con sesiónes musicales y con un uso limitado de máquinas de percusión, sintetizador modular, y con una vendimia de vocoders. El álbum contiene un gran número de colaboradores, entre ellos se destácan: Panda Bear, Chilly Gonzales, DJ Falcon, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, Paul Williams, Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers y Ghallmarck. El álbum fue recibido con críticas positivas.␊

            Durante la primera mitad de 2013, vendió 614 000 copias en los Estados Unidos, donde se convirtió en el décimo álbum más vendido durante dicho periodo.`,

            review: `What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.” So said the Preacher of Ecclesiastes. And he said it two and a half thousand years ago, which puts people moaning about things sounding like the ’80s into perspective.␊
            ␊
            It’s rare to hear a record that doesn’t sound like anything you’ve ever heard, and rarer still to hear one that also puts a smile on your face. How many great bands turn their backs on putting out the same old shit only to release records so calculatingly ‘out there’ they feel like maths homework? They forget this is supposed to be FUN. Yeah, Radiohead, I’m talking to you.␊
            ␊
            Daft Punk have enjoyed near-universal acclaim over 20 years and three albums but ‘Random Access Memories’ is their greatest achievement: an ambitious masterpiece you can’t imagine being made by anyone other than Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.␊
            ␊
            Opener ‘Give Life Back To Music’ sets the tone with guitars that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Giorgio Moroder’s Top Gun score. It features Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Paul Jackson Jr, who played on ‘Thriller’, so it’s as funky as you’d expect. The sound of a happy crowd gurgles in the background. The party’s right here.␊
            ␊
            ‘The Game Of Love’ slips into a slower tempo, as a melancholy android discovers heartbreak. The record is loosely themed around a robot’s attempt to become human, and if he needs a guide who better than the producer who gave us Donna Summer’s ‘I Feel Love’? ‘Giorgio By Moroder’ is a documentary of sorts, in which the titular hero narrates his life story. When he describes the beginnings of the disco beat, we hear an insistent click track. When he tells us that when we create art there are no rules, the music proves him right. It’s a life-affirming salute to the power of the imagination.␊
            ␊
            After this, there’s a sea change. Chilly Gonzales plays a 45-second piano solo that takes us into ‘Within’, marking the transition from the first three tracks. This is a record that’s been painstakingly slaved over. The track itself is restrained, as our robot protagonist begins to realise just how much he’s yet to understand.␊
            ␊
            He’ll be hard-pressed to catch all of Julian Casablancas’ quickfire lyrics on ‘Instant Crush’, an instant nightclub anthem. ‘Lose Yourself To Dance’ is paired with ‘Get Lucky’, representing the album’s poppiest moments and featuring the dream team of Nile Rodgers and Pharrell Williams. Sitting between the two is the record’s startling centrepiece, ‘Touch’. Paul Williams might be best known as a composer for the Muppets, but Daft Punk love him best as Swan, the villainous antihero of operatic horror film Phantom Of The Paradise. His background in psychedelic storytelling is put to use on an eight-minute epic that changes shape every time you draw breath.␊
            ␊
            ‘Beyond’ is another melancholy-hearted collaboration with Paul Williams. ‘Motherboard’ is a long, spacey instrumental that sounds as if it’s somehow melting. ‘Fragments Of Time’ is a further glorious high in which Todd Edwards describes his time in LA and makes you feel like you’re driving a fast car down the west coast of the USA. ‘Doin’ It Right’ features Panda Bear of Animal Collective and is the album’s most forward-looking moment; closing track ‘Contact’ is a DJ Falcon collaboration, and an example of pure musical adrenalin.␊
            ␊
            By assembling a cast of their favourite musicians and delving into their adolescent memories, Daft Punk have created something as emotionally honest as any singer-songwriter confessional – and a lot more fun to dance to. Go out and rejoice: there’s something new under the sun.␊

Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of ten others, making it both Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's most successful single to date. It became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since "Macarena" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996.
