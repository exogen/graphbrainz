entity in MusicBrainz which can be linked to tracks on releases. Each track must
always be associated with a single recording, but a recording can be linked to
any number of tracks.

A recording represents distinct audio that has been used to produce at least one
released track through copying or mastering. A recording itself is never
produced solely through copying or mastering.

Generally, the audio represented by a recording corresponds to the audio at a
stage in the production process before any final mastering but after any editing
or mixing.`,
