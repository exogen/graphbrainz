hop genres. They are often not sanctioned by the artist’s label, may lack proper
sample or song clearances and vary widely in production and recording quality.
While mixtapes are generally DJ-mixed, they are distinct from commercial DJ
mixes (which are usually deemed compilations) and are defined by having a
significant proportion of new material, including original production or
original vocals over top of other artists’ instrumentals. They are distinct from
demos in that they are designed for release directly to the public and fans, not
to labels.`,
